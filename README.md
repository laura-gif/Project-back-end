Hello everybody!
This is my first laravel project.
In this project, I created a site for a pastry shop. 
Each person can log in to this site and see the price and rating of confectionery. 
Also, if they want to buy a product, they can contact the store and the delivery guy will deliver the product.
On this site everyone can get acquainted with the history of the pastry shop.
